n-031,"How to use these decision trees:  These trees are meant to help you identify the important elements within your measurement so that you find the best suited vocabulary code. For all branches related to measurementType, the tree should be used in conjunction with the SeaDataNet facet search to obtain P01 codes.   You will notice other collections (e.g. S07) indicated as you follow along the branches. You do not need to go to these collections to identify sub-elements, these are provided to indicate where that type of information is found. Ultimately you should select a code that best captures your measurementType, measurementUnit, or measurementValue.",Directions,,,
